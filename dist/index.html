          <p>
            Hello! My name is Amanda Billy, and I live, work, and play on the Internet. I’m good at helping people use the web to connect. In the last eight years, I’ve put my skills to good use at two startups, two universities, and a church (usually with some overlap).
          </p>
          <p>
            I live in Jacksonville, Florida, where the summers are too hot and the air is too wet, but the water views and the avenues of oak trees are beautiful enough to make up for it. In my spare time, I like to photograph my dogs, binge watch television shows, and cook new recipes.
          </p>

I can't take credit for the design or development of the theme, but I created the header images from stock photography, and I wrote all of the body copy.</p>
